Names are among the most integral parts of people’s identities. Yet, for various reasons, people change them once or several times throughout their lives. For some, a new name accompanies a transition in identity. For some, it’s a means of adapting to a new culture or country. For others still, it’s a necessary step to ensure safety and privacy. Regardless of the reason, people should feel at home in their names.

That is why we are building **Hello My Name Is**, a name search and organization website. It is designed specifically to meet the needs of users changing their name—such as transgender folks or American immigrants—but can also serve parents and writers seeking name-inspiration.
