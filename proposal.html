            <p>Users will need to create their own account for our app and they will need to log in before using our app.
                There are several ways users can interact with our app. User can search a name directly.
                When they hover their mouse on the name they want to look up, they can view information relavent to the name such as gender, origin, and meaning, etc.
                For users don't have a name in mind but want to find one, they are allowed to filter for a name in the app's database based on their preferences.
                They can filter through categories such as gender, origin, and spelling, etc. to find a name they want.

            <P>
                The sign up and log in feature ensures safety and privavy for users since their information will be secured and not access by other people. Since we create catergories like gender, meaning, origin, spelling, etc. for filtering, users can find a name that target their needs.
                Meanwhile, it supports users from different social groups. Groups such as immigrants and parents can find a meaningful name they want based on their preferences through our app. The bookmark function makes it easier for users to access and compare the names they want though different ways.
                Therefore provides a convenient way for users to choose the name they want. Since our app has features that appeal users needs, we provide a way that maximize users freedom and ownership.
