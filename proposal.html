        <h2>Data Domain</h2>

        <p>
            Names are among the most integral parts of people’s identities. Yet, for various reasons, people change them once or several times throughout their lives. For some, a new name accompanies a transition in identity. For others, it’s a means of adapting to a new culture or country. For others still, it’s a necessary step to ensure safety and privacy. Regardless of the reason, people should feel at home in their names.
        </p>

        <h3>Problem Space</h3>

        <p>
            The problem is that people need an online space to search for, organize, and compare names. However, most existing name-related online tools are designed for a) soon-to-be parents naming their children or b) storytellers naming their fictional characters. This does not fully address the considerations of people seeking to add to or replace their own existing name. For example, someone born outside of the US may be looking for names with a similar sound and meaning as the name in their natural language. Additionally, a transperson might want a name popular during the year they were born, but with a different gender-association than their assigned name.
        </p>

        <h3>Existing Solutions</h3>

        <p>
            Currently, many of the available resources specifically for people changing their own name are online community threads. Some redirect people to existing name search resources, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/2f6lj0/naming_resources_for_you_all/">this Reddit post</a>. Unfortunately, this does not fully solve the problem because resource repositories like these still redirect people primarily to baby name and fantasy name generator websites. Other threads, like <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-common-English-names-Chinese-people-choose">this Quora post</a> for Chinese-to-English names, directly ask for name advice. While this is helpful on a local level, it is not sufficiently scalable to support a large user base. Also worth mentioning are “name-swap” resources for transpeople, like <a href="https://transnameswap.tumblr.com/">this tumblr blog</a>. But, again, these lack user personalization and scalability.
